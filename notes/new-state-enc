possibly should try for a more one-hot state enc

one card is encoded as 13,4, 13 for rank and 4 for suit so 1 hot len 17
hand requires 5 so hand len = [5*17] = [65]

top card = [17]
bottom card = [17]

known oppt cards = known of hand [65] + cards in hand [6] = [71]


maybe still include deadcards as 52 array?
