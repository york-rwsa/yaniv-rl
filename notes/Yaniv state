Round state
[
	Deck : 54 card deck
	Discard pile : 2d list with discards ie: [[H3], [D3, D4, D5], [ST, CT]]
		- discard[0] is the first card put down
		- can change as users pick up and put down cards
	Seen cards : list of known cards in players hands
		- seen_cards[player_id] = [cards picked up from discard pile by player_id]
	
	current_player
	player_discarded = true/false - since there are two steps
	player_picked_up = true/false
	legal_actions: legal actions of the current player
]

-------
state should be encoded as a 52 el binary array

ie the hand can be encoded such:
hand = [0]*52
# turn on card CT will be rankid + suitid= 9+0
hand[9] = 1


-------

so we need

deadcards        -< all cards that cannot be picked up
top discard      -< always populated
bottom discard   -< zeros if only 1 card played
hand 
known cards 52*n -<
hand sizes 
unknown cards
